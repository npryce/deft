After a merge, two feature status files might have the same status and
priority.  The tool should correct this automatically when it indexes
the status files and warn the user.  To correct this, it should put
the two features into some arbitrary order and increase the priority
number of all lower priority features (higher numbers means lower
priority: priority 1 is the highest)
